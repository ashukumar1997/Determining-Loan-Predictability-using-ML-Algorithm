# Determining-Loan-Predictability-using-ML-Algorithm
Loaded a historical dataset usingPandaslibrary, and apply different classification ML algorithm on the data, and find thebest accuracy evaluation methods.–Loan dataset was created using various parameter such as age, gender, education, principal amount, etc.–Data  waspre-processed,  categorical  values  was  converted  to  numerical  values  or  to  binary  variable  usingOne  HotEncodingandnormalizationwas done to obtain zero mean and unit variance.–Training sets was used to build an accurate model and test sets was used to report the accuracy of model by using classificationalgorithm.K-Nearest  Neighbor(KNN),  Decision  Tree,  Support  Vector  Machine,  Logistic  RegressionusingScikit-learn(Sklearn)library.–The final result of the above four algorithms were evaluated usingJaccard, F1-scoreandLog-Lossas parameters.
